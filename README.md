Your task: over a few weeks, develop a persistent version of a todo app using JS frontend and a Rails JSON backend. The guide we will be following is http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html and the assets and design for the todo app will be from http://todomvc.com


Day 1:

1. Get a working rails environment up and running, determine which models will be required, and map out the API design for your app.
2. Set up git repository and begin working on initial imlementation.


Please create a folder named after your github username in this repository and push your work into it as you progress. Later we will combine efforts on a single central repository with a more defined PR review process.
